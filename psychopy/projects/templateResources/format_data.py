"""
This is the bare bones of a data formatting script. Included is the code to read in data files from
the raw_data folder, then save them to the formatted_data folder. Add your own code inbetween to
extract and transform the raw data files.

IMPORTANT: Don't save over the original files! The output of this script should always be the
formatted_data folder.
