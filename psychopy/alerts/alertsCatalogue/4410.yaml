msg: Keyboard {keyboard} ends routine on press, so the key release will carry over to the next routine. This may interfere with other components listening for key releases, such as an editable textbox.

label: Keyboard ending routine on press

synopsis: |
  Keyboard components let you choose whether to listen for a key press or a key release; if a Keyboard component is set 
  to end a routine when pressed, this means that the key will be released in the next routine.

solutions: |
  This could be fine! If you are intending for the key release to be recorded in the following routine, you can ignore 
  this alert. Just be aware that components which listen for key releases, such as an editable textbox, will start the 
  next routine with the key pressed to end the previous routine already inputted. To prevent this, change your Keyboard 
  component to register keypresses on release instead.
